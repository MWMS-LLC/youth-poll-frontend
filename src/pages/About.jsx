        <p><strong>Why we made this</strong></p>
        <p>Everyone's got thoughts. But not everyone gets asked.</p>
        <p>We built My World My Say to make space for thatâ€”<br />to ask, to listen, to reflect.</p>
        <p>This isn't about likes or followers.<br />It's about what's real to youâ€”your feelings, your opinions, your way of making sense of the world.</p>
        <p>We don't collect names or personal info.<br />We don't need to.<br />Because this isn't about being tracked.<br />It's about being heard.</p>
        <p>You answer questions.<br />You see how others feel too.<br />Sometimes, that's all it takes to feel less alone.</p>
        <p>And when you answerâ€”<br />we send a message back.<br />Not a score. Not a judgment.<br />Just something thoughtful,<br />based on what you chose.</p>
        <p>Some messages validate.<br />Some offer adviceâ€”if you want it.<br />You can take it or leave it.</p>
        <p><strong>But one thing's always true:<br />This app was built to be on your side.</strong></p>
